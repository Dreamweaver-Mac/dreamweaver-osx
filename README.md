## What is Dreamweaver?  

**Dreamweaver** is an advanced **website creation and code editing suite** that blends visual design flexibility with robust development tools. Built for designers, developers, and creative professionals, it simplifies the process of building responsive, visually appealing, and standards-compliant websites.  

Originally a product of **Macromedia**, and later developed by **Adobe**, Dreamweaver has evolved into a comprehensive development environment supporting **HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP**, and popular frameworks like **Bootstrap**. Whether you prefer drag-and-drop layout design or precise manual coding, Dreamweaver adapts to your workflow.  

Its **Live View** feature allows real-time page previews, helping users instantly visualize changes without switching browsers. The integrated **Git version control**, **FTP connectivity**, and **syntax-aware code editor** make Dreamweaver an all-in-one solution for building, testing, and publishing modern web projects.  

Dreamweaver is widely used by web developers, marketing teams, and educators alike — offering structured layout tools, dynamic code hints, and seamless integration with other creative tools for faster production and reliable results.
